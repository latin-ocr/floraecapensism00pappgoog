a remedy, derived from tho animal Kinqdom, one,
which if tried properly, will in all probability become
an article of commerce. I allude to the

Hyraceum (mihi.)
much valued by many farmerS, and well known
amongst them, by the rather harsh and unpoetical name
of Dasjespis. Thunberg and other travellers mistook
it'for a kind of bitumen ; but it is in fact the secretiori
of a quadruped, which is common throughout the
Colony, and that lives gregariously on the rocky sum-
mits of mountains, viz. the Klipdas or Hyr-ax capensis.
Itis worthy of note, that this production has baffled
the researches of eminent ZoologistS, who have failed
from even minute dissection, in discovering any specific
secretory organ, from which this matter could be de-
rived. It may be asserted however, that the Hyraceum
is produced by the uropoetical system of the animal just
named, and in order to explain this seeming anomaly‚
it must be observed‚ that the Hyrax drinks very sel-
