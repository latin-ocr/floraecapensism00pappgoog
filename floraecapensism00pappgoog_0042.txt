persollate, thick, J uicy‚ sword-shaped, deflexed‚ glaucone,

prickly throughout, but bearing larger and sharper
spines along the margins· F lowers racemose, crowded.
Stamens double as long as the corolla.

The Cape Aloes are prooured from several species of this
extensive genuS, so peculiar to South Africa. The Aloe
ferox. Lam. a native of Swellendam, is generally acknow-
ledged to yield the best extract. That obtained from the
Aloe africana. Mill. is almost equally good, but not so
bitter‚ nor so powerful as a drastic. It is the produce of the
eastern districtS, whence large quantit-ies areannually exported.
The Aloe commonly used by the ColonistS, is prepared from
the Aloe plicatilis. Mill„ whose extract is a much milder
purgative, and much ,resembles the Barbadoes Aloes, It
inhabits the mountainous range near the Paarl‚ Drakenstein,
and Fransche Hoek. Itis much to be regretted‚ that the
farmers do not take more trouble in purifying this valuable
drug.
