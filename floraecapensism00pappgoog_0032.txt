This species also appears to possess demulcent and emolli-
ent properties, and to be of service in the various diseases of
the chest. It goes by the name of Hottentot’s tea, and
grows near the water courses on the Cape mountainS, has a
pleasant smell, and is much liked by the coloured people,
who infuse it as tea. Sometimes the Helicltrysum auricula-
tum Less„ is used for the same purpose, and under similar
circumstances.

Very few of our indigenous plants are so much in domestic
use as this one, known as Geele-bloemegjes-thee. When
pounded‚ or rubbed between the fingers, it gives an agree-
able scent‚ and the infusion has a pleasant sweetish taste.
It is emollient, and for that reason is highly recommended

in catal-rh, cough, and even consumption. Some of our·

Apothecaries have added this plant to the species pectorales.
