² During the time of the inflorescence of this common, but

beautiful shrub (Suikerbosch)‚ the involucra or its showy
flowers are filled with a sweet watery liquor, which is an
alluremeut to the laborious bee, and to a host of various
insects. This liquid contains a great deal of honey. It is
therefore collected by many farmers, who prepare from it,
byiuspissation‚ a delicious Syrup, which is known as the
Syrtqms Proteae ( Boschjes·stroop), and which is of great use
in cough and pulmonary affections. The Protea Lepidocar-
pon. R. Br. and some other Proteae also supply the same
flavoury juice.

RICINUS. Lm.

(EUPHORBIACEAE.)

61. Bit-inus lividus. Jacq. Stena arborescent‚ branchy.
Leaves pestate, palmated, coloured; their lobes oblong,
serrato-demate.

It is scarcely necessary to say much of a remedy, so uni-
versally known as the one derived from this plant. As
a mild purgative, the Castor Oi! excels all other prepa-
rations, and is daily prescribed in all parts of the globe. It
is desirable however, that, instead of importing this medicine,
the colonists should prepare it themselves for exportation to
, those countrieS, where this useful plant does not grow
spontaneously.

HYAENANCHE. Lmn.

(EUPHORBIACEAE .)

62. Hyaenancheqlobosa. Lamb. An arborescent shrub
8-10 feet high. Branches wrinkled‚ rifted, knotty.
Leaves standing by fours on short stalks‚ urbm-led, oblnng,
reticulated, obtuse, leathery‚ quite entire, glabrous.
Peduncles corymbose, axillary. Flowers monoeciouS.

Though the fruit of this shrub (Wolveboon) has not been
introduced into 'the Materia medica of the Cape, yet it deserves
particular attention. It is highly poisonous, and its four-
celled nuts, when pounded, are used to destroy Hyaenas‚ or
other beasts of prey‚ and seem to contain Strychnium. This
fatal bush is an inhabitant of the Maskamma mountain, in

the neighbourhood of the Olifants River.
