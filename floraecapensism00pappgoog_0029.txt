The Wild Gkamnmile, which in the months of Novem·
ber and December so plentifully covers the Cape Downs, is
one of those plantS, which deserve the peculiar attention
of our Apothecaries. It is a true Matricaria, and in many
respects not only equals, but even surpasses the European
species, Large sums of money are yearly expended in im-
porting this useful and popular dmg, while we can gather a
plant of the same order, the same genus, and the same pro-
perties at our deors, In the more remote parts of the coun-
try, where dispensaries are not so abundantly found as in
the vicinity of our metropolis, the sarmers and the coloured
people employ the wild Chamomile as often, and with the
same good effect, as we do the Matricaria chamomilla,
or the Anthemis nobilis. In short, this herb, which con-
tains a superfluity of volatile oil, is an excellent antispas-
modic‚ and most useful in colic and other spasmodic com-
plaints, while on account of its aromatic bitter teste, it is
recommended as a stomachic in Dyspepsia and in derange—
ments of the digestiva organs generally. Its local applica—
tion as a resolvent, is sufficiently known.

Amongst the medical indigenous plants of the Cape, the
present deserves particular notice. It is well'known to
almost every resident as the Snake-root, having acquired
its vernacular name from its effecte as an antidote against the
bites of venomous snakes‚* with which the country aboundS.
The root of this plant, which is a native of the Eastern Dis· .
tricts, where it grows in the deserts of the Karr00, has a
great similarity to the Radix· Seneqae of the Pharmacopoea.
It is bitter and acrid, and contains a good deal of a resinous
substance, almost homogeneous to that which we observe in
the root of the Polyyala ἕσπερα. In the form of decoction
or tincture, this root is a great favourite with the Colonial
sarmer, in various diseases of the chest, asthma, and such

* 'rba most formidable of these reptiles are the Naja HaJ‘e Merrem.
(Gabra Capella) and the Vmera brac-Imma. euv. (Poffadder.)
