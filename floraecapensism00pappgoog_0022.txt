’ Α strong decoction of the leaves of this specieS, acts as a

SUTHERLANDIA. R. Ba.
(LEGUMINOSAE.)

21. Sutherlandia frutescens R. Br. Shrubby. Stem
erect, twiggy. Leaves stalked‚ alternate, impari-pin-
nate‚ many-yoked; pinnulas· on short petioleS, oblong,
obtuse, emarginate, silky. Flowers racemose‚ pedun-
cled, axillary, scarlet. Lequme ovate, scariouS, inflated.

A fine showy shrub‚ which, on account of its beautiful
scarlet flowerS, is a horticultural ornament, and cultivated as
such in our gardenS. It grows wild in hilly parts all over
the Colony. According to Thunbery (Travels vol. I, pag.
160), the roots and leaves of this plant, when dried and
pulverised, are of use in diseases os the eye. <

ACACIA. NEoK.

22. Aeac-ia horrida. Willd. A large tree. Stem and
branches glabroUS‚ but armed with large white spinous
stipuleS. Leaves bipinnate; pinnoe 2-3 yoked; pinnules
many-yoked‚ oblong, blunt. Leasstalks glanduloue at
base and on the apex. Flowers stalked, axillary‚ glo-
bose‚ polyg‘amouS, yellovv, scented.

The demulcent derived from the Doornboom‚ is well
known as an article ot commerce. It exudes spontane-
ously from the bark of the trunk and brancheS, and hardens
in the sun, without losing its transparency. Although the
Cape Gum is inferior in appearance and in intrinsic value,
to that of Northern Africa, it may yet be improved by
care and attention. The Acacia Giraffae Willd. (Kameel-
doorn), growing beyond the limits of the Cape Colony‚ is
said to yield a superior Gum.
