This umbelliferous plant, which attains a height of from 6
to 8 feet, and is found all over the Colony in moist places»,
or in the ravines os mountains‚ is reputed amongst the inha-
bitants as an excellent diuretic, under the name of Wild
Gelery. A decoction of its leaves proves salutary in cases
os dropsy, and has been even administered successfully in
gravel. At times some resinous matter exudes from the
stem, which however in its appearance, smell, and in every

the name to this specieS‚ seems to have been led astray by
mistake, the real drug being derived from a different plant,
a native of the north of Africa, and probably from a kind of
“ Ferula.

This plant, the Platdoorn or Ziekte-troost of the BoerS, is
one of those few indigenous remedies, which, from the very
establishment of the Colony, have been constantly used by
its inhabitantS. At that early period, the European Settlers,
being often without their necessary stock of medicineS, had
to learn from their Hottentot neighbourS‚ who held this plant
in great esteem. It is demulcent and diuretic, and some-
what approaches the Sarsaparilla. The decoction of the

, root, is the general form under which it is prescribed in lues,

lepra, or cutaneous chronic eruptions of all kinds. It also
furnishes a sort of resin, which is easily procurable by mak-
ing incisions into the root while it is fresh. It has been
shown from chemical experimentS, that the root of this
plant contains an alcaloid, which combined with acids,
assumes the form of neutral saltS. Thus the Arctopium sul-
phur-icum consists of small scaly white crystaIS, which are
astringent in taste‚ and which in half grain doses produce
coagulation of the saliva within the mouth.
