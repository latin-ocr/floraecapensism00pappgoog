PREFACE.

The study of Botany affords to medical men an op-
portunity, of becoming more intimately acquainted with
the properties of such pletum, as fall under their more
mmediate observation. As similar tribes and families
have a similar structure, and very often similar qualitieS,
the Botanist, while judging from analogy‚ will be
enabled to detect the hitherto unknown virtues of
various plants. Although we owe much of our thera-
peutical knowledge to mere accident, yet we can, by
the aid of that Science, set doubts at rest, discet-n cer·
tain plants from others of a similar habit, describe them
properly, and assign them their lace in the system.

The Colony of the Cape of ood Hope with its de-
pendencies‚ occupying an immense tract of land, with
but a scanty and sparse population, has long been re-
puted forits remarkable richness of vegetation—'Phe
old proverb of Semper aliquid novi ex Africa, still
holds good, and will retain its importance and truth,
sor centuries to come, notwithstanding the many dis-
coverie5‚ made during the last fifty yearS, in nearly all
the branches of Natural History‚ by many zealous and
intelligent travellerS.

Little‚ as yet, is known with regard to those of our
indigcnous plantS, which may be useful as MedicineS.
But it is more than likely, that, from the great variety
of South African vegetation, the most valuable drugs
will, at some time or other, be brought to lig-lm*

medical purposes; and 1 have reason to suppose, that the so called

murder of his wife (1838,) are Ballota qfricana Bentk„ a plant, which
resembles the European Horehound. Itis not nal-cotie at all, but has
