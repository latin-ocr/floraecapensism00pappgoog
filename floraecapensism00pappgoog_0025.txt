29. Cotyledon orbiculata Lin. Stem fleshy, leafleSS,
elongated, branchy. Leaves opposite, flat, obovate‚
spatulam, blunt, acuminate‚ (often) farinaceously glau-

This succulent shrub is common in mountainous parts‚‘
The leaves are thick, and from their shape called Varkens- ’
ooren, (Pig's ears). The fresh juice is of service iu Epilepsy,
and has been prescribed by me in the case of a young
man, subject to this frightful disease. Not only were the
symptoms evidently diminished, but subsequent attacks
were less violent. The leaves form au excellent applicatiou
to hard corus, On removal of the epidermis os the upper
side of the leaf, it is left on the part for 8 or 10 houm, when
it will be found that the juicy portion of the leaf is gone,
and the corn feels soft, and may be removed with ease. It
· should be remarked here, that Cras-mla arborescens. Willd.
has the same propertieS. ”

Few Suum-African plantS, are so much in domestic use

both of which, are common in the sandy tracts of the co-
lony. They are astringent aud sourish in taste, on account
of the acidulated alkaline salt, with which they seem to be
impregnated. The ex ressed juice of the succulentleaveS, tak-
en internally, checks bysentery, and acts as a mild diuretic;
while it is also for its antiseptic property, used as an excel·
lent gargle in nialignant sore throat, violent salivation and
Aphthae‚ or in the form of a lotion iu burns and scaldS. At
the Cape these plante are called : Zure Vyyen.
