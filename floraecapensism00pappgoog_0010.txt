At present, we are indebted for the greater partos
our knowledge of Cape remedies to the colonial fa-rmer,
residing in the more remote parts of the interior, or to
the wandering native. These people, deprived of all
medical aid, feel the necessity of trying the efficacy of
different plants within their reach. Several of these
have been employed in various maladies, and some of
them have found their way into the Pharmacopoeia.

During a residence of nearly twenty years in the
Cape Colony as a medical Praetitioner, Ι have with
pleasure devoted much of my time to the study of the
Cape Flora. Observing, that many indigenous plants
were sucessfully used by the Boers and coloured people
as House-remedie8‚ in various complaints, and finding,
that the utility of most of them, was utterly unknown to
the scientific world, Ι commenced collecting the
materiaIS‚ which gave rise to the present publication.
This would have been far more complete and satis·
factory‚ had Ι met with the co-operation of the country
PraetitionerS, who have ample opportunities of becoming
acquainted with the various remedies commonly used.

None of my readers can be more fully convinced
of the deficient-iffi, contained in these pageS, than my-
self ; but Ι have had no other ambition for publishing
them, except the common good, and no other claim, but
that of originality. Ι have called this dissertation a Pro-
drome or Precursor of a more extensive work on the
subject, which I intend commencing‚ when Ι shall
meet with due encouragement.

Exclusive of the South African plants here enumer-
ated and described, there are many others indaily use,
which are Aliens to the Cape Flora, and are either
cultivated in gardenS‚ or have naturalized themselves.
Some of these, it is true, are very useful ,- but Ι thought
it proper to discard them from my list, as [consider
it as a matter of course, that Naturalization should not
qualify them to a full right of Burgership, which only
belongs to those, that are aboriginal and indigenouS.

wishing, however, to render my Catalogue as com-
plete as possible, Ι insert the names of such foreign
medical plantS, as have the confidence of the inhabi-
tants of this Country.

Acorns calamus (Kalmus); Amygdalus communis
