This plant, the Bitter- Wortel of the farmerS, is found
among hilly places in the western part of the Colony. The
root, formerly known to the Dutch apothecaries as the radix
Asclepiadis crispae, is extremely bitter and acrid, and on
account of its diuretic virtues, a decoction or infusion of it
has been recommended in various kinds of dropsy‚ and a
tincture prepared of it is said to be a valuable remedy in

Colic.
SOLANUM. Lm.

(somNAcnAE.)

54. Solarium niveum T hbq. Root perannual. Stem fru-
ticose, 6 feet high, erect, snow-white, tomentose‚ thorny.
Branches prickly. Leaves alternate, stalked, ovate,
attenuate at both ende, entire, nerved. Flowers blue, in
a lateral, decompound panicle. Pedicels dichotomouS,

drooping. Fran, a red glabrous berry.
The leaves of this Solanum are smooth on the upper, and

woolly on the lower surface. The application of the latter ,

to foul ulcers cleanses them, and a cure is afterwards effected
by applying the upper surface. „ Hence their Dutch name of
Geneesblciren. The fresh juice of the bel-ries and leaves,
when formed into an ointment with lard or fat, are also in
x use amongst the farmers for the same purpose.

, This bush deserves notice as a drug, and in all probability
will, ere long, become an article of colonial export. It
grows abundantly in some parts of the Eastern districtS,
whence it has found its way into the dispensary. The flow-
erS, which are called Geele Bloemetjes, closely resemble
Saffron in smell and teste, they possess‘similar medical proper·
