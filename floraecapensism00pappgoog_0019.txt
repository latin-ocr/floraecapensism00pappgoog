DIOSMA. Lm.

(mosmssffl.)
14. Diosma (Barosma) crenata. D. C. A glabrousl

— branchy shrub. Brcmclzes round, pnrplish‚ the upper

and smaller ones angular. L'eaves stalked, smooth‚
oblongo· ovate, blunt, odotted bene-ath, and notched
with transparent‚ resinous glands on their margin.
Flowers peduncled‚ solitary, axillar3y petals white,
oblong‚ subsessile.

The Bucclzu leaves have, as is well known, become
an article of export lalely. Their principal medical effeets
are owing to their possessing a considerable quantity of an
aromatic volatile oil, and to a particular very tenacious
principle, called Βίοεηιὶπ, as also to a semi· resinous sub-
stance. They have a peculiar smell, and a slightly astring-
ent, bitter taste. When used in the form of infusion‚ they
promote perspiration. Hence their utility in chronic Rheu-
matism, Gout, and other diseaseS, caused by the sudden
suppression of cutaneous action. They have been prescribed
also m Cholera MorbuS‚ and are very beneficial in diseases
of the bladder, especially in chronic inflammation of the
mucous membrane of that organ (catarrh of the bladder),
also in Haematuria, CalculuS, and in suppuration of the
vesica, urethra, and prostate gland. By increasing the
secretion of urine, they inipart to it their peculiar smell.
They have also been given in dropsy, ·——in fine, in all those
cachectic and hydoropical complaintS‚ arising from suppres-
sion of the perspiration or urine. As a stimulant to the
stomach‚ some practitioners have used the Bucchu leaves in
indigestion; a sensation of warmth has accordingly been pro—
duced in that organ, and the appetite increased.

* A shoemaker, about 25 years of age, had laboured for some time
under a most obstinate attack of crusta serpiyinoaa. All the usual
remedies having failed, his medical attendant at last advised him, to try a
decoction of this plant, to be applied in a tepid state. With this treat-
ment and occasional aperient-s, and sparo diet, he was perfectly cured
within a mouth. ·
